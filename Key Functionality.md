View challenges
- Anonymous members can view the challenge list and view a challenge overview and program, but if they click join they must create a user account
- For regular users, they can only see challenges that are scheduled in the future, self-directed challenges, and challenges they have created (active or draft)
- Admin users can optionally view all challenges, including those in the past and in draft mode
Viewing a challenge
* If you created the challenge, provides an edit option and shows draft status
* If someone else created it, you can see your status (member/nonmember) and have the option of joining
* Whether you are a member or not, you can view the program (posts), but in-process challenges only show content up to today's date.
